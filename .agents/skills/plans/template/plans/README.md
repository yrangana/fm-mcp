# Planning System

A lightweight, AI-native way to track what we're building, why, and where things stand. No project management tool required.

> This is the onboarding doc inside your project's `plans/` directory. For the full guide and templates, see the [plans repo](https://github.com/yrangana/Plans).

## The Problem It Solves

Software projects accumulate scattered planning documents: stale specs, ideas in Slack, decisions buried in PRs. Over time nobody knows what's planned, what shipped, and what was quietly abandoned.

AI assistants like Claude have the same problem: every new session starts blind. You re-explain context, Claude re-discovers what's in flight, work gets duplicated.

This system gives Claude (and everyone else) a **persistent, structured memory of intent** that survives across sessions.

---

## How It Works

Three layers, each with a distinct job:

```
plans/active/*.md       ← What we're building and why (spec + live status)
plans/plans.json        ← Machine-readable snapshot of all plans
plans/STATUS.md         ← Engineer's front door (in flight, up next)
plans/roadmap.html      ← Stakeholder view (interactive timeline, dependency graph)
```

**Git log** is the ground truth for what actually shipped. Plans are the intent layer. A weekly audit (`/plans sync`) reconciles the two automatically.

---

## Lifecycle of an Idea

```
1. New idea
   → Add a bullet to STATUS.md backlog section
   → Nothing else until committed

2. Work is committed (starting soon)
   → Create plans/active/MY_FEATURE.md with frontmatter + status banner
   → Add a row to STATUS.md "Up next" table

3. Work starts
   → Set in_flight: true in frontmatter
   → Move row to STATUS.md "In flight" table

4. Phase ships
   → Mark phase Done in the plan's ## Status banner
   → Update STATUS.md tables
   → Bump last_updated in both files

5. Everything ships
   → mv plans/active/MY_FEATURE.md plans/shipped/
   → Move row to STATUS.md "Recently shipped"

6. Plan is replaced by a different approach
   → mv plans/active/MY_FEATURE.md plans/superseded/
   → Set status: superseded in frontmatter
   → Note what replaced it in the plan body
   → Remove row from STATUS.md "In flight" / "Up next"
```

## Anatomy of a Plan File

Every plan has two layers:

**1. YAML frontmatter** (machine-readable, at the top of the file):

```yaml
---
status: active            # active | shipped | superseded | paused | blocked
priority: P1              # P0 (critical) to P3 (nice to have)
owner: you
type: feature             # plan | feature | bug | research | spike
depends_on: []            # other plan filenames this is waiting on
blocks: []                # other plan filenames waiting on this
last_updated: 2026-05-04
start_date: 2026-05-01    # Gantt bar start; /plans new defaults this to today
eta: 2026-05-11           # target completion; omit if not yet estimated
---
```

**2. `## Status` banner** (human-readable, second heading in the file):

```markdown
## Status

- **Overall:** In progress, Phase 2 of 3
- **Phase 0 (Design):** Done (2026-04-28)
- **Phase 1 (Backend):** Done (2026-05-01)
- **Phase 2 (Frontend):** In progress
- **Phase 3 (Tests):** Not started

**Next action:** Wire up the state to the API client.
**Last updated:** 2026-05-04
```

**Rule:** frontmatter and banner must agree. If they disagree, frontmatter wins.

## The Views

### STATUS.md, for engineers and Claude

Text-based. Claude reads this at the start of every session to get oriented. Contains:
- **In flight:** what's being worked on now
- **Up next:** committed for the next 30 days
- **Recently shipped:** last 30 days
- **Backlog:** captured ideas, not yet committed
- **Monthly log:** append-only history

### roadmap.html, for stakeholders

Interactive web page. Load it with a local server:
```
python -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080/roadmap.html
```

Shows:
- **Gantt chart:** timeline with progress bars, Today button
- **Dependency graph:** which plans block which
- **Plan cards:** filterable by status, with phase breakdown

Reads `plans.json` directly. No manual updates needed.

---

## What Claude Does With This

At the start of every session, Claude reads `STATUS.md` and relevant plan files. This means:

- **"What's next?"** has a deterministic answer, no re-explaining
- **"Is X shipped?"** Claude cross-checks git log against plan status
- **When you ship something,** Claude knows which plan to update and how
- **Drift detection:** `/plans sync` reads git log, compares to plan frontmatter, proposes fixes

---

## The `/plans` Skill

Four modes that extend your AI assistant (invoked `/plans:plans <mode>` when installed as a Claude Code plugin, `/plans <mode>` when installed project-locally by `plans-init` or `npx skills add yrangana/Plans`):

- **`sync`**: weekly audit. Reads plan files and git log, detects drift, regenerates `plans.json` and `STATUS.md` auto-sections, proposes all changes before writing anything.
- **`new`**: guided creation of a new plan file with correct frontmatter and status banner.
- **`init`**: bootstraps `plans/` in a project, on every install path.
- **`update`**: refreshes `roadmap.html` and this README from the installed skill version.

Get the skill via the Claude Code plugin (`/plugin marketplace add yrangana/Plans`), with `npx skills add yrangana/Plans`, or with `plans-init` (installed automatically). See [github.com/yrangana/Plans](https://github.com/yrangana/Plans).

---

## The session guard

If your assistant is Claude Code, a Stop hook watches the end of each session. When the session changed code, a plan is marked `in_flight: true`, and no file under `plans/` was touched, it asks once per turn for the plan update before the session ends. Update the covering plan's `## Status` banner and `last_updated`, or say that no plan covers the work: either answer satisfies it, and it never asks twice in the same turn.

To turn it off: on a project-local install, remove the two plans entries from `.claude/settings.json`. On the Claude Code plugin install, those entries do not exist locally: the hooks ship inside the plugin itself, so disable or uninstall the `plans` plugin via `/plugin` instead.

---

## Quick Rules

- **One capture point:** ideas go to `STATUS.md` backlog, nowhere else
- **`plans/active/` is the only home for new plans:** never create plan files at the repo root or in an AI assistant's scratch or memory directory (`~/.claude/`, `~/.cursor/`, `.agents/`, `.windsurf/`, or any equivalent). Plans written outside `plans/active/` are invisible to collaborators, the dashboard, and `/plans sync`
- **Every "In flight" / "Up next" row needs a plan file:** create both together
- **Update plans before ending a session:** if a session touched code covered by an active plan, update its `## Status` banner and bump `last_updated` in its frontmatter before finishing. Do not defer this to a follow-up session
- **Don't bulk-migrate old plans:** triage them on-demand when revisited
- **`plans.json` is auto-generated:** edit plan `.md` files, never the JSON directly
