# Drift Detection Rules

Run all 13 rules. Collect all findings before reporting.

## Rule 1: Missing frontmatter field

**Check:** Each active plan has all 7 creation-required fields: `status`, `priority`, `owner`, `type`, `depends_on`, `blocks`, `last_updated`.

**Flag:** List each missing field with expected type/values.

---

## Rule 2: Two-source disagreement

**Check:** Frontmatter `status` matches the `## Status` banner's Overall line.

| Frontmatter status | Expected banner indicator |
|---|---|
| `active` | In progress / Not started / Paused / Blocked |
| `shipped` | Done |
| `paused` | Paused |
| `blocked` | Blocked |
| `superseded` | any |

**Resolution:** Frontmatter wins. Propose updating the banner to match.

---

## Rule 3: Stale active plan

**Check:** Plan has `status: active` but no commits in the last 14 days that touch files plausibly related to that plan (match on plan filename stem or keywords from the plan title against commit messages and changed file paths).

**Flag:** "Active for Xd with no recent commits. Paused or abandoned?"

Do not auto-resolve. Ask the user.

---

## Rule 4: Stale last_updated

**Check:** An active plan has recent commits (within 7d) touching its domain, but `last_updated` in frontmatter is more than 7 days ago.

**Propose:** Bump `last_updated` to today's date in both frontmatter and banner.

---

## Rule 5: Unrecorded shipped phase

**Check:** Recent commits (since last STATUS.md update) contain messages that suggest a feature shipped (e.g. "merge", "complete", "ship", "done", "release", or a plan filename stem) but the corresponding plan phase is still marked Not started or In progress.

**Propose:** Mark the relevant phase as Done with today's date.

This is a heuristic. Present the matching commits so the user can confirm.

---

## Rule 6: Plan not in STATUS.md

**Check:** A file exists in `plans/active/` but has no corresponding row in the "In flight" or "Up next" tables in STATUS.md.

**Propose:** Add a row to the appropriate table based on `in_flight` field.

---

## Rule 7: Orphaned STATUS.md row

**Check:** A row exists in STATUS.md "In flight" or "Up next" tables but no matching file in `plans/active/`.

**Flag:** "Row exists in STATUS.md but no plan file found. Create the plan file or demote to backlog?"

Do not auto-resolve.

---

## Rule 8: Orphaned dependency edge

**Check:** Plan A has `depends_on: [B]` but plan B does not list `blocks: [A]`. Or vice versa.

**Propose:** Add the missing reverse edge to plan B's frontmatter.

---

## Rule 9: Dependency cycle

**Check:** BFS/DFS on the `depends_on` graph across all plans (active + shipped). Detect any cycle.

**Flag:** Print the cycle path (e.g. A → B → C → A).

Cannot auto-resolve. User must break the cycle manually.

---

## Rule 10: Missing timeline data

**Check:** An active plan has neither an `eta` (in frontmatter or banner) nor any dated phase line in the `## Status` banner. `start_date` alone does not satisfy this rule: a plan needs an end to draw a span.

**Flag:** "No `eta` and no dated phases. The Gantt cannot draw a real span for this plan."

Do not auto-resolve. The user sets an `eta` (a `/plans new`-style effort estimate) or adds phase dates. This is a warning, not an error: undated plans still render, just as a fallback span.

---

## Rule 11: Stale start_date on an unstarted plan

**Check:** A plan with `status: active`, `in_flight: false`, and every phase still `Not started` has a `start_date` in the past. A `start_date` in the future is correct (the plan is scheduled to start later) and is left alone.

**Propose:** Roll `start_date` forward to today. If the plan has an `eta`, slide it forward by the same delta (`eta += today - old start_date`) so the planned span length is preserved rather than shrunk. Apply only to `active` plans; leave `blocked` and `paused` plans untouched.

This keeps the Gantt honest: an unstarted plan should not show a bar whose left edge is in the past. Propose the roll; the user confirms or declines.

---

## Rule 12: Missing project header

**Check:** `plans/plans.json` is either a top-level array (legacy shape) or an object without a `project` key.

**Resolution:** Auto-create a stub `"project": {"name": "", "description": "", "repo": ""}` during regeneration in Step 4. Note it in the sync report so the adopter knows to fill it in. This is not an error: a fresh project or a legacy file is expected to hit this once.

---

## Rule 13: Empty project field

**Check:** `project.name`, `project.description`, or `project.repo` is an empty string.

**Flag:** "project.{field} is empty. Fill it in in plans/plans.json: it appears in roadmap.html and any centralised dashboard."

Do not auto-resolve. Cannot infer a project name from context reliably; the adopter must provide it.
