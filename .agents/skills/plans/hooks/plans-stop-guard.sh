# Stop hook for the plans plugin.
#
# Blocks the stop, once, when this session changed code while an in-flight
# plan exists and nothing under plans/ was updated. The block carries a
# reason telling the model how to satisfy the guard; stop_hook_active
# guarantees the second stop always passes, so the cost is at most one
# extra turn.
#
# The stop_hook_active check is mandatory, not a nicety. Claude Code caps
# consecutive Stop-hook blocks (9 in build 2.1.274) and force-overrides
# past that, so a hook that ignores the flag would block repeatedly and
# then silently stop enforcing. Returning success as soon as the flag is
# true keeps this guard at exactly one block per turn, well under the cap.
#
# Fails open everywhere. Any missing input, missing tool, or unexpected
# error exits 0 silently, because a hook bug must never trap a user in a
# session they cannot end.
#
# Reads the session marker written by plans-context.sh: mtime is the
# session start, content is the starting HEAD.

# Guard the stdin read: Claude Code pipes JSON and closes the pipe, so a
# plain `cat` is safe there, but this script can also run by hand, under a
# different harness, or under a future build that does not close stdin. A
# blocking read here would hang the whole session with no way out, which
# is the one failure mode this hook cannot have. `[ -t 0 ]` (stdin is a
# terminal) skips the read entirely; a non-terminal stdin that is simply
# empty still returns immediately at EOF.

# 1. Loop guard. The second stop of a turn always passes. Two independent

# and no regex portability surface, and the existing _json_bool parse.
# This is deliberate belt-and-suspenders, not redundancy for its own
# sake: this exact single point of failure already broke once, silently.
# _json_bool's earlier \(true\|false\) alternation is a GNU sed
# extension that BSD sed does not support, so on a machine with BSD sed
# it always returned empty, the loop guard never fired, and the guard
# would have blocked every turn up to Claude Code's 9-block cap and then
# gone silent forever past it. Neither check can be used to weaken the
# guard below once-per-turn: both read only the current invocation's raw
# stdin, not any persisted state, so there is no way to satisfy either
# check without a genuine stop_hook_active:true on this call.
