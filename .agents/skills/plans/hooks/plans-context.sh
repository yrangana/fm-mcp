# SessionStart hook for the plans plugin.
#
# hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext is a documented mechanism: Claude
# Code's official hooks reference states that the string is wrapped in a
# system reminder and inserted into the model's context at the point the
# hook fires, capped at 10,000 characters. This payload is well under
# that cap (under 900 characters).
#
# This hook must be fast and side-effect free apart from one write: when
# the project has adopted the convention, it records a per-session marker
# file (mtime = session start, content = starting HEAD) that the Stop
# guard reads to scope "what changed this session". The marker lives in
# the session scratchpad when one is supplied, otherwise in TMPDIR. It is
# written once per session and never read by anything else. The hook
# never prompts, never touches the project tree, and always exits 0.
set -u

# Only inject the plans/ rules when this project has adopted the
# convention. Guard on the project root, not the process cwd: a
# SessionStart hook can run from any working directory. The convention
# always places plans/ at the repository root, so resolve that root by
# trying three candidates in order, using the first one whose directory
# actually contains plans/:
#
#   1. $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, when it is set and non-empty. This is the
#      documented way to reference the project root, but it is not
#      reliably set to the repo root in every session shape.
#   2. The git repository root (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`), run
#      from the current directory. This is the reliable case: adopters
#      are in git repos, and the convention lives at that repo's root.
#      Git's stderr is discarded and a nonzero exit (not a git repo, or
#      git missing) is handled without failing the hook.
#   3. The current directory, preserving the original behavior as a
#      last resort for non-git projects.
#
# If none of the three yields a directory containing plans/, emit
# nothing. An unrelated directory that happens to contain a plans/
# folder only matches via step 3, same as before this fix.
#
# This three-candidate resolution is duplicated in plans-stop-guard.sh
# and must stay identical there. The Stop guard resolves the same root
# to find the same marker file this hook writes; if the two ever
# disagree on where that root is, the guard reads a marker that was
# never written and silently stops enforcing, with no error either
# side.
